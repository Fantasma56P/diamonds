PROJECT OBJECTIVE
Using the ‘Diamonds’ dataset from Kaggle, we are investigating how diamond cut affects diamond clarity.

Step Followed 

1-Validate the data

2-Prepare the data for visualization

3-Create the visualizations

Tool Used 
R

Data base
Kaggle

Key Finding
As cut quality increases from Fair to Ideal, the number of diamonds rises sharply, and the mix skews toward mid clarities (VS2–SI1), while top-clarity stones (VVS1/IF) remain relatively scarce at every cut grade.
